            <p>We generally define 'HOBBIES' as the job we like to do in our free time. But for me hobby is the job
                that you take out your time for and enjoy every moment of it. Hobbies are actually important in everyone's life 
                as it helps one to refresh and makes happy at the same time. And yes I love to dance and usually take out my time to
                enjoy the moment when I do dancing. Dancing has been my hobby from my childhood. I used to perform at stage
                in every function at the school and continue to do that in my college. I have recently started my instagram dance page
                 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dance.with.sawee/" class="highlight">@dance.with.sawee</a> to give more time to the job
                I really love to do!!.
                <p>Let me tell you how dancing became my hobby. When I was a kid my mother used to take me to dance classes to learn
                   how to dance and thats how I get into it. I really thank my mumma for this. She has inculcated such good hobbies in me.
                   From then I also used to perform in every family function and I really feel happy from the feedbacks and responses I recieve
                   from the audiences. A performer seek for such good feedbacks and then work on improving it. For me dancing is not just my hobby,
                   it is something that helps me forget everything and let me just enjoy the moment. 
                </p>
                <p>During my school days, there was one inter-state competition named "Surbhi Dance Competition". So I made a team
                    of 5-6 girls and prepared a dance performance to participate in that competition. It was the first time I participated in a dance
                    competition along with a team. I was the one to choreograph the steps and help others learn the same. The song was one of the famous song 
                    of that time. I hope you have listened it "Jhoom-Barabar-Jhoom". So, then we prepared and performed in the first round. And do you know the results? 
                    Yup, we got selected!! That was the moment I can never explain in words. Then we prepared more well for the next round and this was more
                    tough than before. But we performed. The results were not the same as before, but the experience we had was amazing. And I can 
                    never ever forget that experience. I am also grateful that I got such a good family that encourages and appreciates me in every point of time.
                    And helps me remind that life comes with many ups and downs, but we should never stop and continue to do what we love. So here I am continuing my
                    dance journey and will not stop doing it because it's the thing that makes me happy!!

                <p>I also love to make mandalas. It really requires much patience to complete a single art of mandala. And I am also learning the art 
                    from different people who are expert at it.</p>

                <p>I hope you get what I was trying to convey from this short blog. </p>

                <p>Please check out my page to see how I enjoy my hobbies!!</p>
