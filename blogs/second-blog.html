            <p> Have you heard this quote 'Mindset Matters'? I am sure you do. But what exactly does it mean. For me
                Mindset is the most important key which can let you take most important decisions of life. Having a
                positive mindset will change your life for good and yes we all know that!! But then why don't we think with the
                same mindset.</p>
                <p>Lets know how can we always think in that direction? The
                    most simple answer is "Peace". Whenever we think peacefully, we drive towards positivity and that's
                    why people practice meditation. Because it helps them to think afresh and enhances positivity to their life. 
                    But their are other ways too through which you can let your mind remain in peace. Some of them are 
                    <ul>
                        <li class="peace-list">Loving what we do</li>
                        <li class="peace-list">Traveling to beautiful places</li>
                        <li class="peace-list">Helping others</li>
                        <li class="peace-list">Taking care of loved ones</li>
                        <li class="peace-list">Taking care of Mother Earth</li>
                        <li class="peace-list">Giving others a reason to smile</li>
                        <li class="peace-list">Accepting people as they are</li>
                        <li class="peace-list">Spending time with family</li>
                    </ul>
                   <p>
                   So lets find out your way of what makes you drive towards positivity. You can try out these things I mentioned above. But 
                   there are millions of other things that people do to live their life with Positive Mindset. Please share with me if you have some different ideas.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                   So at last I wanted to say is "just be yourself and happy". Let your mind remain in peace. You will attract positive people with positive mindset. 
                   And eventually you will also start thinking with the same mindset.</p>
